India, the second-most populous nation with a population of 1.353 billion, is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels in the world which is responsible for global warming. An ever-increasing population is projected until 2050, and consequently, the energy demand in the upcoming decades will be co-accelerated by the rapid industrial growth. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) with the support of National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog is working to achieve the Indian Government's target of attaining 175 GW through renewable energy resources. Many Indian states are currently increasing their renewable energy capacity in an objective to meet future energy demand. The review paper discusses in-depth about the three Indian states, namely Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, which pioneers the renewable energy production in India. The global energy scenario was discussed in detail with Indian contrast. Further, the barriers to the development of renewable energy generation and policies of the Indian government are discussed in detail to promote renewable energy generation throughout India as well as globally since the challenges are similar for other nations. This study analyzed various prospects of the country in renewable energy which has been done in a purpose to help the scholars, researchers, and policymakers of the nation, as it gives an insight into the present renewable energy scenario of the country.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072152","Renewable energy potential;global energy scenario;Energy policy in India;renewable energy barriers;prospects of renewables in India;renewable energy in India","Renewable energy sources;Production;Global warming;Fossil fuels;Meteorology;Electric potential;Sociology","energy harvesting;energy management systems;fossil fuels;global warming;government policies;renewable energy sources;reviews;sustainable development","global energy scenario;renewable energy development;environment-friendly energy harvesting;sustainable development goals;social progress;National Institution for Transforming India Aayog;Indian government policies;renewable energy resources;energy demand;comprehensive review;NITI;MNRE;Ministry of New and Renewable Energy;SDGs;fossil fuels;Karnataka;Gujarat;Tamil Nadu;power 175.0 GW","","228","","228","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a global consensus in increasing the share of renewable energy-based generation in the overall mix, transitioning to a more environmental-friendly transportation with electric vehicles as well as liberalizing the electricity markets, much to the distaste of traditional utility companies. All of these changes are against the status quo and introduce new paradigms in the way the power systems operate. The generation penetrates distribution networks, renewables introduce intermittency, and liberalized markets need more competitive operation with the existing assets. All of these challenges require using some sort of storage device to develop viable power system operation solutions. There are different types of storage systems with different costs, operation characteristics, and potential applications. Understanding these is vital for the future design of power systems whether it be for short-term transient operation or long-term generation planning. In this paper, the state-of-the-art storage systems and their characteristics are thoroughly reviewed along with the cutting edge research prototypes.

This new grid paradigm has arisen to build a flexible electric power system that better coordinates energy resources and loads aiming at efficiently delivering sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. As a part of the smart grids (SGs), microgrids (MGs) have been developed to exploit the full benefits from the integration of distributed energy resources, especially distributed renewable generation based on variable and intermittent sources, such as wind and solar. Nevertheless, meeting all these goal requires the implementation of innovative energy storage technologies integrated with high efficiency and very fast response electronic power conditioning systems to interface with the electrical grid. Power electronics systems play a key role in regulating the raw energy from energy storage systems (ESSs) and connecting to the electrical grid. Hence, this paper performs a comprehensive analysis of major technologies in electrical energy storage systems and their electronic interface for applications in smart grids.

Most current works on this issue require a subject-specific adaptation step before applied to a new user. Thus the research of directly extending a pre-trained model to new users is particularly desired and indispensable. As brain dynamics fluctuate considerably across different subjects, it is challenging to design practical hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge. Regarding this gap, this paper proposes a Graph-based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Model (G-CRAM) to explore EEG features across different subjects for motor imagery classification. A graph structure is first developed to represent the positioning information of EEG nodes. Then a convolutional recurrent attention model learns EEG features from both spatial and temporal dimensions and emphasizes on the most distinguishable temporal periods. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark EEG datasets of motor imagery classification on the subject-independent testing. The results show that the G-CRAM achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods regarding recognition accuracy and ROC-AUC. Furthermore, model interpretation studies reveal the learning process of different neural network components and demonstrate that the proposed model can extract detailed features efficiently.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2020.2967128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961150","EEG;Motor Imagery;Deep Learning","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Synchronous motors;Deep learning;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Informatics","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;signal classification","motor imagery classification;motor rehabilitation;subject-specific adaptation step;graph-based convolutional recurrent attention model;graph embedded EEG signals;EEG features;EEG nodes;ROC-AUC","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Cues;Electroencephalography;Humans;Imagination;Neural Networks, Computer","45","","55","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It was initiated in the mid-1970s, catalyzed by skyrocketing oil prices. Since the mid-2000s, it has quickly evolved into a prominent research field encompassing an expansive and growing number of research groups and organizations across the world. The main conclusion of most of these studies is that 100% renewables is feasible worldwide at low cost. Advanced concepts and methods now enable the field to chart realistic as well as cost- or resource-optimized and efficient transition pathways to a future without the use of fossil fuels. Such proposed pathways in turn, have helped spur 100% renewable energy policy targets and actions, leading to more research. In most transition pathways, solar energy and wind power increasingly emerge as the central pillars of a sustainable energy system combined with energy efficiency measures. Cost-optimization modeling and greater resource availability tend to lead to higher solar photovoltaic shares, while emphasis on energy supply diversification tends to point to higher wind power contributions. Recent research has focused on the challenges and opportunities regarding grid congestion, energy storage, sector coupling, electrification of transport and industry implying power-to-X and hydrogen-to-X, and the inclusion of natural and technical carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches. The result is a holistic vision of the transition towards a net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy that can limit global warming to 1.5°C with a clearly defined carbon budget in a sustainable and cost-effective manner based on 100% renewable energy-industry-CDR systems. Initially, the field encountered very strong skepticism. Therefore, this paper also includes a response to major critiques against 100% renewable energy systems, and also discusses the institutional inertia that hampers adoption by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as possible negative connections to community acceptance and energy justice. We conclude by discussing how this emergent research field can further progress to the benefit of society.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3193402","Business Finland through the P2XENABLE Project(grant numbers:8588/31/2019); Academy of Finland through the Industrial Emissions and CDR Project(grant numbers:329313); LUT University Research Platform “GreenRenew.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837910","Climate safety;energy transition;power-to-X;100% renewable energy;sector coupling","Renewable energy sources;Fuels;System analysis and design;Hydrogen;Jacobian matrices;Hydroelectric power generation;Wind power generation;Global warming","air pollution control;carbon compounds;climate mitigation;energy conservation;environmental economics;fossil fuels;global warming;optimisation;photovoltaic power systems;power generation economics;pricing;sustainable development;wind power plants","transition pathways;renewable energy policy targets;solar energy;sustainable energy system;energy efficiency measures;cost-optimization modeling;energy supply diversification;wind power;energy storage;cost-effective manner;international energy agency;energy justice;skyrocketing oil prices;organizational aspect;fossil fuels;resource availability;solar photovoltaic system;grid congestion;sector coupling;power-to-X;hydrogen-to-X;carbon dioxide removal approach;net-negative greenhouse gas emissions economy;global warming;carbon budget;renewable energy-industry-CDR systems;institutional inertia;intergovernmental panel;climate change;temperature 1.5 degC;CO2","","31","","474","CCBY","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem with electricity supply chain network design (ESCND) using smart grid has not been broadly explored by researchers. This paper aims to approach this problem using a multiobjective robust optimization method. The three objectives are economic (profit maximization), environmental (greenhouse gas emissions minimization), and resilience (network resilience maximization). Efficiency maximization-power loss minimization-has also been taken into account using its corresponding cost element in the economic objective function. The proposed approach accounts for different unique smart grid components such as demand side management programs, microgrid structure, two-way distribution lines, and supplier-consumer nodes, while incorporating different interrelated decisions including facility location, capacity expansion, load allocation, and pricing. To solve the resultant model, a hybrid multiobjective robust optimization technique is proposed based on cutting plane and AUGMECON2 algorithms. The proposed model and solution approach are then applied to an actual case study and the produced results are thoroughly analyzed. We find that while economic and environmental objectives can be strictly conflicting, the implementation of smart grids can result in concurrent boost in both environmental performance and network resilience.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2017.2749638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067448","Adjustable robust optimization;cutting plane algorithm;electricity;multiobjective optimization;resilience;smart grid;supply chain network design (SCND);sustainability","Smart grids;Supply chains;Optimization;Biological system modeling;Robustness;Resilience;Economics","demand side management;facility location;integer programming;nonlinear programming;pricing;profitability;smart power grids;supply chain management;supply chains","efficiency maximization;interrelated decisions;ESCND;power loss minimization;facility location;unique smart grid components;economic objectives;solution approach;hybrid multiobjective robust optimization technique;economic objective function;network resilience maximization;greenhouse gas emissions minimization;profit maximization;multiobjective robust optimization method;electricity supply chain network design;efficient electricity supply chains;sustainable electricity supply chains;multiobjective robust optimization approach;electricity supply chain networks;resilient design;environmental performance;environmental objectives","","24","","69","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the elastic nature of cloud computing, this shortcoming ends up significantly reducing the real benefit, viz., the cost-effectiveness of cloud adoption for Cloud Service Consumers (CSC). Similarly, detecting and eliminating such over-provisioning of cloud resources without affecting the quality of service (QoS) is extremely difficult for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) since they have visibility only into the state of the IT services (cloud resources) but none into the actual performance of business services. In this paper, we propose Tier-centric Business Impact and Cost Analysis (T-BICA), a tier-centric optimal resource allocation algorithm, to address the problem of rapid provisioning of IT resources in modern enterprise cloud environments, through extensive data gathering and performance analyses of business services in a simulated environment emulating a mature cloud service provider. We have derived improved analytics to address the issues and to accelerate real cloud adoption for large enterprises within the context of meeting (or exceeding) business service level objectives (SLOs) and minimizing the cloud subscription cost (OpEx) for the business. While investigating the problem, we consider the time and the cost of delivering business service in mediumto large-size enterprise environments, quantifying the negative impact of IT resource over-provisioning (due to highly mature IT services centric orchestration capabilities) on the business, and indicate how the suggested cloud analytics could assist in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the business service. From our analysis of the test data, we have observed that our suggested approach and analytic reduces the cost of delivering business services by 65.19 percent, and improves the performance (total time to deliver) by 74.18 percent when compared to the existing modern cloud management and resource provisioning approach. Using T-BICA dramatically reduces upfront costs (CapEx) for CSPs (from the capacity procurement and management points of view) through efficient on-demand resource de-provisioning, without affecting business SLOs and IT service level agreements (SLAs). The improved dynamic allocation of resources also makes for better efficiency of utilization, which in turn has desirable consequences for sustainability, and makes this an approach for “Green” IT.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2424888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7090992","Cloud computing;infrastructure as a service;public cloud;private cloud;business impact analysis;business service;SLO;SLA;business applications;multi-tier system;over-provisioning;cloud service provider;cloud service consumer","Resource management;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Algorithm design and analysis;Organizations;Banking","cloud computing;resource allocation","tier-centric resource allocation;multitier cloud systems;cloud computing;cloud service consumers;CSP;tier-centric business impact and cost analysis;T-BICA;business service level objectives;SLO;cloud subscription cost;on-demand resource de-provisioning","","18","","48","IEEE","21 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physical proximity of these edge devices will allow for intelligent reasoning one hop away from data generation. This will allow a range of modern urban reasoning applications that require reduced latency and jitter such as remote surgery, vehicle collision detection and augmented reality. The traffic flow from IoT devices to the cloud will also be reduced as with the increased accuracy from deep learning models only a subset of the data will need to be reported after a first pass analysis. However, the training time of deep learning models can be long, taking weeks on multiple desktop GPUs for large datasets. In this paper we show how transfer learning can be used to update the last layers of pre-trained models at the edge of the network, dramatically reducing the training time and allowing the model to perform new tasks without data ever having to be sent to the cloud. This will also improve the users' privacy, which is a key requirement for urban intelligence applications with the introduction of GDPR.

Turkmenistan ratified the Agreement and is a country with absolute reliance on fossil fuels and practically zero installed renewable energy capacity. This study provides potential transition scenarios to full sustainability for Turkmenistan in power, heat and transport sectors. Vast sunny desert plains of Turkmenistan could enable the country to switch to 100% renewable energy by 2050, with prospects to have 76% solar photovoltaics and 8.5% wind power capacities in a Best Policy Scenario. Seven different transition scenarios, with different GHG emissions cost assumptions and transition rates, have been analysed to demonstrate different possible paths towards full sustainability in a cost-efficient way. The results of the study demonstrate that a 100% renewable energy system, regardless of the transition rate, will be lower in cost than a continual reliance on fossil fuels. The scenario with the highest rate of renewable energy integration enables the least cost system and quickest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The results are expected to serve as a guideline to policymakers in Turkmenistan. The structural results for transition speed options and respective costs and benefits from switching a practically fully fossil fuels based system to a fully renewable energy system are expected to be transferable to many countries.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3050817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319673","100% renewable energy;energy transition;policy scenario;sector coupling;sustainable development;Turkmenistan","Heating systems;Space heating;Water heating;Sustainable development;Table lookup;Statistics;Sociology;Climate change;Global warming","air pollution;air pollution control;climate mitigation;environmental economics;fossil fuels;global warming;government policies;renewable energy sources;sustainable development","sustainability;Turkmenistan;transport sectors;vast sunny desert plains;76% solar photovoltaics;8.5% wind power capacities;Best Policy Scenario;seven different transition scenarios;transition rates;different possible paths;cost-efficient way;100% renewable energy system;transition rate;renewable energy integration;cost system;greenhouse gas emissions;transition speed options;respective costs;practically fully fossil fuels;fully renewable energy system;fast transitioning;fully sustainable energy system;Paris Agreement;United Nations Framework Convention;Climate Change;global warming;absolute reliance;practically zero installed renewable energy capacity;potential transition scenarios","","14","","68","CCBY","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fossil fuels also represent the main source of economic income in the region. Climate change is closely associated with the use of fossil fuels, and it has become the main motivation driving the GCC countries to search for alternative solutions, such as renewable energy technologies, to eliminate their reliance on fossil fuels and the climate burden attached. The GCC countries have all adopted plans for economic development and diversification to be implemented over two decades. Such plans are strengthened by a framework for long-term planning, which includes a strategic commitment to pursue the development process in a sustainable manner. This research provides a comprehensive review and strict follow-up to shed light on the renewable energy projects implemented in the GCC region and critically discusses future prospects. The projects foreshadow the GCC countries’ ability to comply with the future requirements and to spearhead the renewable energy transition towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The main findings of this research reveal that the GCC countries have achieved significant progress in the field of renewable energy deployment. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are at the top of the list for global renewable energy projects, while Kuwait and Oman have also announced the progress of their projects and have honored their pledges. We find that Bahrain and Qatar need to exercise more transparency in regard to disclosing information about the developments of their renewable energy projects. Finally, although several promising renewable energy projects are underway or have been announced in the region, their completion should be accelerated, and more projects must be implemented to fully meet the decarbonization targets and climate constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039936","International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC); Ventures Onsite–Ventures Middle East; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266039","Climate change;energy transition;GCC countries;projects progress;renewable energy;transition towards sustainability","Oils;Renewable energy sources;Meteorology;Natural gas;Economic indicators;Statistics;Sociology;Climate change","air pollution control;fossil fuels;power generation economics;power generation planning;renewable energy sources","climate constraints;decarbonization targets;Qatar;Bahrain;Oman;Kuwait;Saudi Arabia;United Arab Emirates;sustainable manner;strategic commitment;motivation driving;climate change;economic income;GCC countries renewable energy penetration;renewable energy transition;long-term planning;economic development;fossil fuels;Gulf Cooperation Council;energy sector projects;global renewable energy projects","","13","","92","CCBY","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A basic demand in such a geo-distributed data center system is to transfer bulk volumes of data from one data center to another. Geographic distribution and large delay-tolerance of such inter-data-center bulk data transfers provide cloud service providers opportunities to optimize the operating cost. Most existing studies on inter-data-center bulk data transfers focus on minimizing the network bandwidth cost. However, the energy-cost of the bulk data transfers, which also accounts for a large proportion of operating cost in the data centers, still remains unexplored. This is an important problem, especially in the multi-electricity-market environment, where the electricity price exhibits both spatial and temporal diversities. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of how to route and schedule inter-data-center bulk data transfers to minimize the energy-cost for geo-distributed data centers. We model this problem as a min-cost multi-commodity flow problem and develop an efficient two-stage optimization method to solve it. Extensive evaluations with real-life inter-data-center network and electricity prices show that our method brings significant energy-cost savings over existing bulk data transfer methods.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2017.2739160","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602175); National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFA0502300); National Science and Technology Supporting Program of China(grant numbers:2015BAH18F02); Model Information Service Industry Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:GDEID2010IS049); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:222201514331,ZH1726108); Informatization Development in Shanghai(grant numbers:201602008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010368","Data center;bulk data transfer;energy-cost;geographical load balance","Data transfer;Cloud computing;Bandwidth;Data centers;Optimization;Quality of service;Network reliability","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network reliability;optimisation;power aware computing;pricing;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication scheduling","cloud service provider;interdata-center bulk data transfers;interdata-center network;min-cost multicommodity flow problem;network bandwidth;geographic distribution;geo-distributed data center system;geographically distributed data centers;bulk data transfer methods;electricity prices","","12","","43","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are three kinds of fastest path problems: SSFP (Single-Staring Time Fastest Path) that has a fixed departure time, ISFP (Interval-Staring Time Fastest Path) that selects the best departure time from an interval, and FPP (Fastest Path Profile) that returns the travel time of the entire time domain. In this paper, we aim to answer these three queries in time-dependent road network faster by extending the 2-hop labeling approach, which is fast in answering shortest distance query in the static graph. However, it is hard to construct index for SSFP and ISFP because there are $|\mathcal {T}|$|T| and $|\mathcal {T}|^2$|T|2 possible time points and intervals, where $\mathcal {T}$T is the time domain. Therefore, we first propose the time-dependent hop-labeling for FPP, then provide the specific optimizations for SSFP and ISFP query answering. Moreover, it is both time and space consuming to build an index in a large time-dependent graph, so we partition road network into smaller sub-graphs and build indexes within and between the partitions. Furthermore, we propose an online approximation technique AT-Dijkstra and a bottom-up compression method to further reduce the label size, save construction time and speedup query answering. Experiments on real world road network show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art fastest path index approaches and can speed up the query answering by hundreds of times.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2981062","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP200103650,LP180100018); Hong Kong RGC ECS(grant numbers:24203419); CUHK(grant numbers:4055114); CUHK University Startup(grant numbers:4930911,5501570); Tencent; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9040652","Path finding;query processing;time dependnet graph;road network;hop labeling","Indexes;Roads;Cost function;Labeling;Time-domain analysis;Complexity theory;Google","approximation theory;computational complexity;data compression;graph theory;network theory (graphs);query processing;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","time-dependent hop-labeling;time-dependent road network;time-dependent function;fastest path problems;SSFP;2-hop labeling approach;time-dependent graph;fastest path query answering;single-staring time fastest path;interval-staring time fastest path;fastest path profile;ISFP;AT-Dijkstra online approximation technique;bottom-up compression method;fastest path index","","9","","40","IEEE","18 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this case, there is a proven association between the smart cities and the smart devices, which have caused the power systems to become more flexible, controllable and detectable. Along with these promising results, many disputes have been generated over the cyber-attacks as unpredictable destructive threats, if not properly repelled, which could seriously endanger the power system. With this in mind, this paper explores a novel stochastic virtual assignment (SVA) method based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach, where the essential data of the system sections are broadcasted decentralized through the data blocks, as a worthwhile step to deal with the cyber attacks’ risk. To do so, an additional security layer is added to the data blocks aiming to enhance the security of the data against the long lasting data sampling by virtually assigning the hash addresses (HAs) to the data blocks, which are randomly changed based on a stochastic process. The basic network architecture is based on a Provchain structure as a new framework to constantly monitor data operation. Two pivotal strategies also represented to deal with the energy and time needed for the HAs generation process, which have improved the proposed method. In this paper, the proposed security framework is implemented in a smart city environment to provide a secure energy transaction platform. Results show the authenticity of this model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVA method in decreasing the successful probability of cyber threat, increasing the time needed for the cyber attacker to decrypt and manipulate the data block.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3069354","FEDER funds through COMPETE 2020; Portuguese funds through FCT(grant numbers:POCI-010145-FEDER029803 (02/SAICT/2017)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9394809","Smart city;energy transaction;data security;virtual assignment approach;cyber-attacks","Smart cities;Vehicle-to-grid;Batteries;Microgrids;Cogeneration;Transportation;Blockchain","computer crime;cryptography;directed graphs;probability;smart cities;stochastic processes","transportation systems;energy hub;smart cities;smart devices;power system;directed acyclic graph;system sections;data block;cyber attacks;security layer;cyber threat;stochastic virtual assignment;SVA;Provchain structure;hash addresses;HAs","","8","","42","IEEE","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As systems increase in heterogeneity, workload distribution becomes a more core problem to achieve the maximum efficiency in every computational component. We present a Multi-Objective Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) approach where several objectives can be applied to tune an application. These objectives can be dynamically exchanged during the execution of an algorithm to better adapt to the resources available in a system. We have implemented the Multi-Objective DLB together with a generic heuristic engine, designed to perform multiple strategies for DLB in iterative problems. We also present Ull Multiobjective Framework (UllMF), an open-source tool that implements the Multi-Objective generic approach. UllMF separates metric gathering, objective functions to be optimized and load balancing algorithms, and improves code portability using a simple interface to reduce the costs of new implementations.

The energy consumption for the data center cooling system is positively related to the air temperature outside the data center. The difference of data center internal temperature and the outside air temperature varies from each data center location. If we reschedule the workload of Internet cloud services to the least temperature difference, the cooling energy consumption will be the biggest savings. The cooling energy-consumption model and query characteristics of cloud services provide the methodology to formulate the energy consumption and workload rescheduling. However, the cloud service must meet the tail latency constraint after the rescheduling. We solve this problem by estimating the high-percentile tail latency and scheduling the cloud service to where can meet the tail latency constraint. At last, a proactive weather-aware geo-scheduling algorithm, called EC3, is proposed to distribute end-users' loads among data centers so as to reduce the cooling energy consumption.

Despite the recent advances in transfer optimization, however, a continuing challenge is the scalability of associated algorithms given big data of source problem instances. This paper tackles the scaling problem of an online adaptive knowledge transfer framework under big source data. We propose an efficient source selection algorithm based on the theory of multi-armed bandits such that the most related source task to the target is chosen for knowledge transfer, as opposed to extracting knowledge from all sources simultaneously. For this purpose, we introduce a novel and principled reward measure to reflect the source-target similarities. The efficacy of our proposed approach is assessed on the well-known knapsack problem that has practical implications in optimization of supply chain and manufacturing processes. Extensive experiments are conducted under big data of source problem instances. The numerical results clearly reveal that the incorporation of the proposed source selection mechanism in the existing adaptive knowledge transfer framework makes it successfully feasible for fast/real-time decision-making in the big data source setting.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006274","transfer optimization;scalability;big data;multi-armed bandits","Optimization;Task analysis;Big Data;Knowledge transfer;Computational modeling;Search problems;Convergence","Big Data;decision making;knapsack problems;knowledge acquisition","knapsack problem;big data;online adaptive knowledge transfer;source selection algorithm;multiarmed bandits theory;decision-making processes;planning;transfer optimization","","4","","19","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As we know, stop time and train length were often considered in a fixed manner in train stop planning for high-speed rail (HSR). One obvious disadvantage was that it often resulted in insufficient time for passengers to get on or get off a train. In addition, fixed train length may cause a waste of train capacity. And travel demand was usually assumed to be deterministic, although travel demand usually was stochastic. In this paper, we presented an optimization model that simultaneously optimized the stop-schedule, the stop time schedule and the train length schedule for each train trip under stochastic demand. By formulating deterministic equivalents to the chance constraints, we obtained a deterministic mixed integer model. To solve the problem, a novel column generation-based heuristic solution technique based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle and column generation procedure was proposed. Some numerical experiments and a case study based on real-world data were used to demonstrate that the proposed solution method can yield a service plan within a reasonable time compared with ILOG Cplex. Besides, the variable train length and stop time model needed fewer carriages and also gave rise to less total time loss compared with the fixed scenario.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940050","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1201402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1734204); Key Projects of China Railway Corporation(grant numbers:P2018X003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827476","Column generation;Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition;high-speed rail (HSR);mathematical programming;scientific computing;stochastic demand;stop-schedule;stop time;train length","Stochastic processes;Rail transportation;Linear programming;Schedules;Heuristic algorithms;Programming","integer programming;linear programming;planning;railways;scheduling;stochastic processes;transportation","train stop planning;variable train length;high-speed rail;stochastic demand;fixed train length;train capacity;travel demand;stop time schedule;train length schedule;train trip;time model;Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle;column generation-based heuristic solution technique;deterministic mixed integer model;chance constraints;deterministic equivalents;optimization model","","4","","65","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The methods to solve one-dimensional cutting stock problems can be divided into two types: (1) exact algorithm, and (2) approximation algorithm. The execution time of an exact algorithm will increase to an unacceptable degree if the scale of the problem is larger. Since the one-dimensional cutting stock problem is a constrained optimization problem, the methods of genetic algorithm are suitable to solve this problem. The chromosome encodes the index of the stock material that demand pieces will be cut from. Then, the chromosome initialization process combining with random and heuristic scheme was proposed. Since infeasible solution may be generated after crossover and mutation operation were applied on chromosomes. A repair process was proposed to keep the offspring feasible. Experimentation shows that the proposed method actually can obtain an approximation solution in the constraint of acceptable time cost.","","978-1-7281-0543-7","10.1109/LifeTech.2019.8884020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884020","cutting stock problem;genetic algorithm;np-hard problem","Genetic algorithms;Biological cells;Optimization;Computer science;Raw materials;Approximation algorithms;Maintenance engineering","approximation theory;bin packing;genetic algorithms;stock control","heuristic scheme;crossover operation;mutation operation;repair process;approximation solution;chromosome initialization process;random scheme;approximation algorithm;exact algorithm;multiple length cutting stock problem;stock material;constrained optimization problem;one-dimensional cutting stock problem;multiple stock lengths;genetic algorithm approach","","3","","15","IEEE","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Critical Decision-Making on Cloud Computing Adoption in Organizations Based on Augmented Force Field Analysis","A. E. Youssef; A. M. Mostafa","College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","IEEE Access","25 Nov 2019","2019","7","","167229","167239","Cloud Computing (CC) has become an important milestone information technology that attracts many organizations. With the potential to transform business processes, lower IT expenses, and offer access to unlimited computing resources with minimal management effort, organizations look to cloud-based solutions to achieve business efficiencies. Thus, it would seem that these organizations could easily migrate to CC. However, enterprises are still concerned about moving their business-critical applications to the cloud. Among the reasons are that it is an emerging technology that has not reached a level of maturity; the lack of industry-specific conformity to standards; and a high level of security risks. As a result, there is a big dispute among organizations on the decision of whether it is more business-efficient to embark on the cloud or remain with their interior IT infrastructures. In this paper, we aim to solve this debate by proposing a novel approach that supports decision-making on CC adoption in organizations. Unlike traditional decision-making approaches that pay little or no consideration to organizational high-level business objectives, our proposed approach is driven by the business objectives of the organization. First, we identify driving and restraining forces that influence CC adoption in organizations. Second, a formal decision-making model is proposed based on Force Field Analysis (FFA) augmented by pairwise comparison and Delphi methods, this model estimates the values of the driving and restraining forces based on their impacts on the organization's objectives. By analyzing the forces for and against CC adoption, organizations can decide whether or not to move forward with the adoption. Alternatively, organizations can use the analysis to think about how they can strengthen the forces that support the adoption and weaken the forces opposing it, so that the adoption is more successful. The proposed model is validated for usability and applicability through a use case scenario.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2954415","King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906122","Cloud computing;decision making;force field analysis (FFA);pairwise comparison;Delphi method","Organizations;Cloud computing;Standards organizations;Decision making;Force;Software","business data processing;cloud computing;decision support systems","business efficiencies;business-critical applications;decision-making approach;organizational high-level business objectives;formal decision-making model;augmented force field analysis;cloud computing adoption;business-efficient applications","","3","","56","CCBY","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
